### Hi, I'm Hugo Cortell ðŸ•¹
My name is Hugo and I'm a game designer from Spain.   
I have studied at both NYU  and VFS and I'm currently working on finding a job.

I have experience with C#, Lua and Shellscript.  
Though I personally prefer to leave the programming to the professionals.

I have a passion for all things that push the envelope of technology and design.
